# Spam-Mail-Detection
# Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect and classify spam emails, reducing the risk of phishing attacks, malware infections, and other cyber threats. The goal is to create a system that can automatically identify and filter out spam emails, improving email security and user experience.

# Key Features
# Data Collection:
A dataset of labeled emails (spam and non-spam) is collected and preprocessed for training the model.
# Model Development:
A machine learning model is developed and trained using the collected dataset to learn the patterns and relationships between email features and spam behavior.
# Model Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability and effectiveness.
# Deployment: 
The trained model is deployed as a web application or API, allowing email service providers to integrate it into their existing systems and receive real-time spam detection.

# Technical Details
# Programming Language:
Python
# Machine Learning Library:
Numpy,Pandas,Scikit-learn,Logistic Regression
# Dataset: 
A collection of labeled email data from Kaggle.
